                    forces into Vesta, with Mission Codename Fireflight laying the groundwork for a beachhead in
                    northern Okasnia, which is occupied currently by Revolutionary Guard forces. From their
                    fortified position on the island of Indalore, the NVRG have launched non-stop terror
                    campaigns against the Okasnians, aimed at keeping their naval and air forces occupied and
                    unable to strike into the more vulnerable positions of the Vestan mainland.</p>

                    failure to capture the LSA high command, the Okasnians broke off and were met with swift
                    retribution by the newly formed NVRG. The attacks into the archipelago have not stopped,

                Ambassador Nilan Bannerjee, a high-ranking Union diplomat, was not rescued during Operation Solstice

                useful
                political alternative to the NVRG, who are seen in the outskirts of the old Sovereignty as
                oppressive
                and draconian. Further intelligence will need to be gathered to determine the viability of this
                effort.

                        supply chain
                        has been largely focused on providing a strong frontline. While the former VSAF

                            The Bad Suns is a mercenary company well known to Union. They have made a vast
                            fortune
                            by opposing Union expansion in the frontier worlds, allying with the Aun, the
                            Karrakins
                            and now the NVRG to stymie Union recontact endeavors in the outer rim.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p class="p-6">They are able to field several hundred mech chassis across their multiple
                        theaters of
                        operation, and their numbers on Cressidium are estimated to be somewhere between
                        thirty and
                        forty chassis, which indicates a significant investment by the company and a
                        significant
                        payout by the NVRG. Their equipment is well kept, and they utilize frames from
                        smaller,
                        local manufacturers, as well as some from more reputable and well known foundries
                        under the
                        Union umbrella. Though technically few in number, their capabilities should not be
                        underestimated.

                    <h3 class="text-lg">Tactical Profile</h3>
                    <p class="p-6">The Bad Suns field an extensive array of high powered, high quality
                        chassis
                        piloted by veterans of multiple conflicts. As a result, forces deployed by the Bad
                        Suns tend
                        to be smaller in number than either the NVRG or Rogue Planet contingents, but much
                        higher in
                        lethality per unit fielded. They are often times employed in mixed formations with
                        both NVRG
                        and Rogue Planet forces, though almost always in a commanderie or auxiliary
                        capacity.</p>

                            A relatively new contender in the privatized warfare sector, Rogue Planet
                            operates on a much
                            larger scale than most other mercenary companies. Rogue Planet fields great
                            swathes of
                            automated chaff units that form a vast frontline to protect backline officers
                            and
                            controllers. </p>
                    </div>

                    <p class="p-6">Their "flood the zone" strategy makes them an excellent battering ram and
                        invasion force, their automated armies more than capable of following simple
                        "Capture and
                        Hold" directives. Where a hammer is needed, the Rogue Planet excels, but they
                        are not entirely without precision. Their backline Command and Control detachments
                        not only
                        oversee the direction of their frontline forces, but also field cadres of capable
                        electronic
                        warfare units. When fielded behind their veritable body-shield of metal grunts,
                        these
                        specialists can be used like a scalpel, attacking both infrastructure and enemy
                        systems to
                        great effect.

                        Their backline is comprised of artillery, e-warfare specialists and long-range
